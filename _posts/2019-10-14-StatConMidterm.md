with respect to a given case, where such intention
is rendered doubtful,
among others, by reason of the fact that
the given case is not provided in the law
***

#### Cardinal Rules in Interpreting the Constitution
1. Verba legis \- amap, the words of the law should be given ordinary meaning
2. Ratio legis est anima \- intent of the framers
3. Ut magis valeat quam pereat \- as a whole

#### When Necessary:
1. Language is not clear, ambiguous, doubtful
2. When reasonable minds disagree

> ##### When the law speaks in clear and categorical language, there is no room for interpretation or construction. There is only room for application.
